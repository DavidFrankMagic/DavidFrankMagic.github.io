"Working with David couldn't have been easier, and I recommend him to anyone looking for an awesome entertainment experience regardless of age. His arsenal of tricks is original, witty, and a showstopper, and I know David will only be adding more and can't wait to see all the success he achieves. You'll have an easy, friendly, and attentive person to work with who will execute on anything you ask. Couldn't recommend David more."
